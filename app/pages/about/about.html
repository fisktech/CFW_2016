      This application was developed by Scott Fisk, Cyclone Family Weekend VP of Technology &amp; Communications. <br /><br /></p><h4>Meet The Developer</h4><p>Hello! My name is Scott Fisk. I am a junior in Management Information Systems here at Iowa State University! I have always had a passion for technology and love to use my skills to teach others! I currently work with the LAS College Information Technology Team. I am also the Director of IT for the Inter-Residence Hall Association. In my spare time I enjoy programming, web design, graphic design and playing the piano (super high-tech, I know)! I also teach a programming class for K-5 students at the Ames Public Library. In the future I hope to work in the field of Information Assurance.
